# Reflections
1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

The entire project took me 2 to 3 days.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

I am planning to organize my repos so that I can generate efficiency in my work and also read all the instructions given beacuse it helped me a lot in my assignment 1.
